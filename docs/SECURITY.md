- Password Reset: 3 attempts per hour

**XSS Protection:**
- HTML sanitization with configurable allowed tags
- URL validation to prevent javascript: and data: URLs
- Input escaping and validation
- CSP header generation

### ‚úÖ Credential Security Management

**What was fixed:**
- **CRITICAL**: Removed exposed credentials from repository (.env file)
- **CRITICAL**: Implemented secure credential generation system
- **HIGH**: Removed weak default password fallbacks from Docker Compose
- **MEDIUM**: Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future credential exposure

**Security improvements:**
- All passwords are now 24+ characters with high entropy
- JWT secrets are 64-character cryptographically secure tokens
- InfluxDB tokens are 64-character hex values
- Encrypted backup system for credential recovery
- Proper file permissions (600) on credential files

### ‚úÖ Secrets Management System

**Implementation:**
- Created `SecretManager` class for centralized credential handling
- Environment-based secret loading with validation
- Automatic credential masking in logs and error messages
- Support for Docker secrets and external secret management
- Configuration validation and health checks

**Features:**
- Singleton pattern for consistent access
- Async initialization with error handling
- Sensitive data masking for logs
- Required vs optional secret validation
- Future-ready for credential rotation

### ‚úÖ Command Injection Prevention

**Security measures:**
- Validated existing `SafeCommandExecutor` implementation
- Input sanitization for all shell commands
- Whitelist-based command validation
- Argument length limits and pattern validation
- Timeout protection for command execution

**Protected operations:**
- Docker container management
- Network operations
- Resource stress testing
- File system operations

### ‚úÖ Secure Configuration Service

**Implementation:**
- Created `SecureConfigService` for centralized configuration
- Integration with `SecretManager` for secure credential access
- Type-safe configuration interfaces
- Validation for all service configurations
- Configuration summary without sensitive data exposure
