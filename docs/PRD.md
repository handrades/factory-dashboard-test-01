# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Factory Dashboard Monitoring System

### Project Overview
A modern, real-time factory monitoring dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and GSAP animations. The system provides comprehensive monitoring and visualization of industrial production lines with interactive equipment animations and real-time data updates.

### Product Vision
Create an intuitive, visually appealing dashboard that allows factory operators to monitor multiple production lines, track equipment status, and quickly identify issues through animated visualizations and real-time metrics.

- Efficiency calculations with realistic fluctuations
- Equipment status management
- Data persistence during navigation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Automatic data refresh intervals
- ✅ Realistic value ranges and fluctuations
- ✅ Consistent state across components
