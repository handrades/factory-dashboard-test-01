# Security Hardening Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive security hardening across the factory dashboard system. The current system has several critical security vulnerabilities including exposed credentials, weak authentication, and potential injection attacks. This security hardening initiative will address these vulnerabilities and implement industry-standard security practices to protect the factory monitoring infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Credential Security Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all credentials to be securely managed and never exposed in version control, so that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all credentials SHALL be loaded from secure environment variables or secrets management
2. WHEN credentials are logged THEN they SHALL be masked or redacted to prevent exposure
3. WHEN the repository is accessed THEN no actual credentials SHALL be visible in any committed files
4. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use strong, unique passwords for each service
5. IF a credential is compromised THEN the system SHALL support credential rotation without service downtime

### Requirement 2: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the dashboard to require authentication and implement role-based access control, so that only authorized personnel can access factory monitoring data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN they SHALL be required to authenticate with valid credentials
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and account lockout protection
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN they SHALL only access resources appropriate to their role
4. WHEN user sessions are created THEN they SHALL have configurable timeout periods
5. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL validate authentication tokens

### Requirement 3: Network Security

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want all network communications to be secured and services to be properly isolated, so that the factory monitoring system is protected from network-based attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate internally THEN they SHALL use encrypted connections where possible
2. WHEN external access is required THEN only necessary ports SHALL be exposed
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN services SHALL be isolated using Docker networks
4. WHEN HTTPS is available THEN all web traffic SHALL be redirected to secure connections
5. WHEN reverse proxy is configured THEN it SHALL implement proper security headers

### Requirement 4: Input Validation and Injection Prevention

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all user inputs and system commands to be properly validated and sanitized, so that injection attacks cannot compromise the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN it SHALL be validated against expected formats and ranges
2. WHEN system commands are executed THEN parameters SHALL be properly sanitized
3. WHEN database queries are constructed THEN they SHALL use parameterized queries
4. WHEN HTML content is rendered THEN it SHALL be properly escaped to prevent XSS
5. WHEN file operations are performed THEN path traversal attacks SHALL be prevented

### Requirement 5: Security Headers and Browser Protection

**User Story:** As a web security specialist, I want the web application to implement comprehensive security headers, so that browser-based attacks are mitigated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web application loads THEN it SHALL include Content Security Policy headers
2. WHEN HTTPS is used THEN Strict Transport Security headers SHALL be set
3. WHEN frames are used THEN X-Frame-Options SHALL prevent clickjacking
4. WHEN content types are served THEN X-Content-Type-Options SHALL prevent MIME sniffing
5. WHEN referrer information is sent THEN it SHALL be controlled by Referrer-Policy headers

### Requirement 6: Secrets Management and Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a secure secrets management system that supports different deployment environments, so that credentials can be managed safely across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN secrets SHALL be loaded from environment-appropriate sources
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN secrets SHALL not be exposed in logs or error messages
3. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN each SHALL have unique credentials
4. WHEN secrets are rotated THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading without downtime
5. WHEN backup and recovery occurs THEN secrets SHALL be handled securely

### Requirement 7: Security Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a security operations center analyst, I want comprehensive security logging and monitoring, so that security incidents can be detected and investigated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN alerts SHALL be generated
3. WHEN security logs are created THEN they SHALL include timestamps, source IPs, and user context
4. WHEN log analysis is performed THEN security events SHALL be easily identifiable
5. WHEN incidents occur THEN sufficient information SHALL be available for forensic analysis

### Requirement 8: Dependency and Container Security

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want all dependencies and container images to be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, so that known security issues are identified and addressed promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN they SHALL be scanned for known vulnerabilities
2. WHEN container images are built THEN they SHALL use minimal base images and non-root users
3. WHEN security patches are available THEN they SHALL be applied in a timely manner
4. WHEN third-party libraries are used THEN they SHALL be from trusted sources
5. WHEN vulnerability scans are performed THEN results SHALL be tracked and remediated
